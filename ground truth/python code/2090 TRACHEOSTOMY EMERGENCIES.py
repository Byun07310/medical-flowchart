      "- Types of tracheostomies include cuffed, uncuffed, fenestrated (allowing for speech), and unfenestrated\n"
      "- Ask if family has a suction catheter and use theirs if available to ensure appropriate size. If none available, inquire as to size. If size unknown, estimate by doubling the inner diameter of the tracheostomy tube and rounding down to the available size catheter\n"
      "- Never force suction catheter. When inserting, allow catheter to gently follow the curvature of the tracheostomy\n"
      "- If tracheostomy tube is a double lumen tube, the inner cannula must be in place to attach the bag-valve mask. Remove the inner cannula to suction and then re-insert. If outer flange becomes removed, it requires a Paramedic to replace.\n"
      "- Apply suction only while withdrawing catheter from the tracheostomy tube, never during insertion and always <100mmHg of suction\n")
