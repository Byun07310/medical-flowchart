# 20 Medical Flowchart Dataset and Python Code

## Overview
This repository contains:
- **`ground_truth/`**: A folder containing two subfolders:
  - **`flowchart/`**: Contains medical flowcharts in image format (e.g., `8030 HEAD TRAUMA.jpg`).
  - **`python_code/`**: Contains corresponding Python code files (e.g., `  - **`flowchart/`**: Contains medical flowcharts in image format (e.g., `8030 HEAD TRAUMA.jpg`)..py`).

Each flowchart file in `flowchart/` has a corresponding Python script with the same filename in `python_code/`.

## Folder Structure
- `ground_truth/`
  - `flowchart/` (e.g., `  - **`flowchart/`**: Contains medical flowcharts in image format (e.g., `8030 HEAD TRAUMA.jpg`).0.jpg`)
  - `python_code/` (e.g., `  - **`flowchart/`**: Contains medical flowcharts in image format (e.g., `8030 HEAD TRAUMA.jpg`)..py`)

## Usage
- Use the flowcharts for medical scenario visualization.
- Refer to the Python code for structured programmatic representations of the flowcharts.
